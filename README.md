# Python_Class_Code
Code from Python Class, to demonstrate my understanding and level of coding

Over my second year of my business degree, we cover Python over 2 semesters

Instead of just submitting my code and 'by word of mouth' explain my understanding,
i have uploaded my development and class work to my GitHub for
future employers
and
myself, to remind and compare my growth and problem solving ability
